/*
    The payment wall plugin for the PayPal Plus integration.
    The following methods can be used to interact with this plugin:

        - createPaymentWall(string parentElement);
            Renders the payment wall into the provided element.
            This element should be a jQuery element of the type div.

        - clearSelection();
            Deselects the payment method.

    In addition to the methods displayed above, the following events can be used:

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/load
            Will be fired if the payment wall was successfully initialized

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/enableContinue
            Will be fired if a payment method is being selected in the iFrame

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/disableContinue
            Will be fired if a payment method is being deselected in the iFrame

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/beforeCreate
            Will be fired before the actual payment wall object is being created

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/afterCreate
            Will be fired after the actual payment wall object was created

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/thirdPartyPaymentMethodSelected
            Will be fired if a third party payment method is being selected in the iFrame

        - plugin/swagPayPalUnifiedPaymentWall/thirdPartyPaymentMethodDeselected
            Will be fired if a third party payment method is being deselected in the iFrame
